# Hi there welcome to my GitHub!

#### My name's Nikolai and I love coding, I have so many ideas of things to create but not enough time to work on them ðŸ˜„
#### Right now I'm finishing up my personal website - I have several more features I want to add to it before it's done for the time being.

#### I'm currently working on several certifications to boost my knowledge in Agile, a couple technologies, and some languages as well.

#### Long term goals:
#### 1. Finish building the internal website for my friend's startup company
#### 2. Create a CNN that can play chess against me - based off my chess codebase (needs a lot of revision)
#### 3. Finish developing my investment manager
#### 4. Create an ergonomic and highly functional & integrated platform for note management, life planning & organization, fitness scheduling - i.e. for maintaining productivity without getting overwhelmed (I personally write a lot of things down, and it's hard keeping track of it all) 

#### For more on me checkout my website: https://nikolailong.github.io/NikolaiLong/ (in my NikolaiLong repository)
